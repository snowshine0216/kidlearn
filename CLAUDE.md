## Core Functional Programming Principles

### Pure Functions
- Functions must be deterministic: same input always produces same output
- No side effects: no mutations, no I/O, no logging inside pure functions
- Separate pure logic from effects (API calls, file operations, network requests)

### Immutability
- Use `const` by default; avoid `let` unless mutation is truly necessary
- Never mutate function arguments or objects passed as parameters
- Use spread operator, map, filter, reduce instead of push, splice, pop
- Fluent builders return new objects via spread: `{ ...state, key: val }` (NOT `this.key = val`)

### Composition
- Build complex behavior from small, composable functions
- Each function should do one thing well
- Prefer function composition over inheritance or large classes

### Explicit Data Flow
- Make dependencies visible in function signatures
- Pass data explicitly through parameters
- Return transformed data rather than mutating in place

### Avoid Shared Mutable State
- No global variables or module-level mutable state
- Isolate state changes to explicit boundaries (I/O layer)

## Code Organization

### Module Boundaries
- Each module should have a single, clear purpose
- Keep modules small and focused (< 200 lines ideal)
- Define clear interfaces between modules

### Data Flow Architecture
- Separate pure logic from side effects
- Structure code as: Input → Transform → Output
- Keep I/O operations at the edges


### Function Size
- Keep functions small (< 20 lines ideal)
- Extract complex logic into named helper functions
- Use early returns to reduce nesting

### Avoid Classes with Mutable State
- Prefer modules of pure functions over classes
- Use classes only when you need polymorphism

---

## Test-Driven Development

All coding must follow TDD. Tests are written before implementation.

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
1. **Red**: Write a failing test that specifies the desired behavior
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping tests green

### Rules
- Never write implementation code without a failing test first
- Write the simplest code that makes the test pass — no more
- Each test covers one behavior or scenario
- Tests must be fast, isolated, and deterministic
- Keep test code as clean as production code

### Test Structure
- Unit tests for pure functions (no mocks needed)
- Integration tests only at I/O boundaries
- Test file mirrors source file: `foo.mjs` → `foo.test.mjs`

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Mutating function arguments or global state
- ❌ Hidden I/O inside pure functions (logging, API calls)
- ❌ Large functions that do multiple things (> 50 lines)
- ❌ Deeply nested conditionals (> 3 levels)
- ❌ Shared mutable state between modules
- ❌ `this.key = val` in fluent builders (breaks immutability)
- ❌ Passing webhook URLs as CLI positional args (bearer token exposure)
- ✅ Return new values instead of mutating
- ✅ Separate computation from effects
- ✅ Small, focused functions with early returns
- ✅ Immutable fluent builders via spread: `{ ...state, key: val }`

## Skill Routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health
